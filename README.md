# The Perfect Fantasy Football League

The purpose of this document (and repo) is to document the configuration, rules and scoring for the "perfect" fantasy football league. Perfection is in the eye of the beholder, so for the sake of this document we will describe a fantasy football league that:

1. Gives every person an equal chance to win.
2. Rewards basic research, but does not require knowledge of 3rd string WRs.
3. Mirrors the real-life value of NFL players in fantasy.
4. Minimized things like collusion, lopsides trades and quitting on the season.

For now we will adhere to the constraints of what can be done in Yahoo! Fantasy Football since that is the dominant platform for fantasy football.
