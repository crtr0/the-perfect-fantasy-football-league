# The Perfect Fantasy Football League

The purpose of this document (and repo) is to document the configuration, rules and scoring for the "perfect" fantasy football league. 

For now we will adhere to the constraints of what can be done in Yahoo! Fantasy Football. 

Perfect is defined as maximizing the fun elements of fantasy football and minimizing the things that ruin it.

Fun Elements include:
- Everyone having an equal chance to win
- Mirroring value in real life with value in fantasy
- Rewarding effort (research, tracking news)

Negative scenarios include:
- Collusion
- Teams giving up when out of contention
- Stacked rosters
